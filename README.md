# python-equation-solver
A mathematical equation solver written in Python. It takes an algebraic equation as an input, then simplifies it and computes the answer.

To onlookers of this project, ignore this for now. This is a test to verify that Git is working for me.

**Sept. 24, 2020** - The project is semi-functional. It doesn't handle negative numbers very well, but I'm working on fixing that.
